C# Circle Calculation Assignment
This repository contains a simple C# console application that demonstrates basic mathematical calculations and console output in C#.
Project Overview
The application calculates and displays:

The area of a circle with radius 9.0
The circumference of a circle with radius 9.0

Files in the Repository

Program.cs: Contains the main program logic
AssemblyInfo.cs: Assembly metadata information
app.config: Application configuration file
.csproj files: Project configuration files
Compiled outputs: .exe and .pdb files

How It Works
The program:

Defines the value of π (pi) as 3.14159
Sets the radius to 9.0
Calculates the area using the formula: A = π × r²
Calculates the circumference using the formula: C = 2 × π × r
Displays the results in the console

Running the Program
The application was created using SharpDevelop. To run the program:

Open the solution in SharpDevelop or Visual Studio
Build the solution
Run the application
The program will display the area and circumference values
Press any key to exit the program

Sample Output
CopyHello World!
254.46879
56.54862
