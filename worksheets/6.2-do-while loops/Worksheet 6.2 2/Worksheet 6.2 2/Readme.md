# Worksheet 6.2 - Console Application  

## Overview  
This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates a `do-while` loop. The program initializes a counter and repeatedly divides it by `3`, printing the result in each iteration until the counter is less than or equal to `1`.

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"2."` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `counter = 48`.  
- Uses a **do-while loop** to:  
  - Divide `counter` by `3`.  
  - Print the current value of `counter`.  
  - Repeat the process while `counter > 1`.  
- Displays a message prompting the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the decreasing values of `counter` printed on the console.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Modify the program to accept user input for the initial value of `counter`.  
- Implement error handling to manage invalid inputs.
