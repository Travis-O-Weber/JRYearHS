## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates multiple `while` loops to perform different counting operations, including incrementing, decrementing, and repeating a message multiple times.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
The program contains several loops performing different tasks:

1. **Incrementing by 5 (`num`)**  
   - Initializes `num = 5`.  
   - Uses a `while` loop to print `num` and increment it by `5` until `num < 105`.  

2. **Decrementing by 5 (`p`)**  
   - Initializes `p = 100`.  
   - Uses a `while` loop to print `p` and decrement it by `5` until `p > 0`.  

3. **Printing a name multiple times (`c`)**  
   - Initializes `c = 1`.  
   - Uses a `while` loop to print `"Travis Weber"` five times.  

4. **Countdown to blastoff**  
   - Prints `"10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 blastoff"`.  

5. **Program Exit**  
   - Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the sequences:
   - Numbers counting up by `5`.
   - Numbers counting down by `5`.
   - `"Travis Weber"` printed five times.
   - A final countdown message.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to customize the increment, decrement, and number of repetitions.  
- Implement a real-time countdown with delays.
