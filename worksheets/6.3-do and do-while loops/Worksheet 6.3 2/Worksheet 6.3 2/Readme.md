# Worksheet 6.2 - Console Application  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to decrement a variable and print its value at each step until a specified condition is met.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `x = 3`.  
- Uses a **while loop** to:  
  - Decrement `x` by `1`.  
  - Print the current value of `x`.  
  - Repeat the process while `x >= -2`.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the values of `x` as they decrement from `3` to `-2`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to specify the starting value and decrement step.  
- Modify the loop to include additional conditions or different decrement values.
