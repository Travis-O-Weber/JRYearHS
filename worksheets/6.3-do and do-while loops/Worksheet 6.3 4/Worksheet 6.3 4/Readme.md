# Worksheet 6.4 - Console Application  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `do-while` loop to print a sequence of numbers, starting from `-4` and incrementing by `3` until reaching `20`.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `number = -4`.  
- Uses a **do-while loop** to:  
  - Print the current value of `number`.  
  - Increment `number` by `3`.  
  - Repeat the process while `number <= 20`.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the sequence of numbers printed from `-4` to `20`, incrementing by `3`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to specify the starting value and increment step.  
- Modify the loop to include additional conditions or custom stopping points.
