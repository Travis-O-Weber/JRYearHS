# Worksheet 6.3 - Console Application  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to print a series of numbers along with their squared values, stopping when the square reaches or exceeds `100`.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `num = 1`.  
- Uses a **while loop** to:  
  - Print `num` followed by another instance of `num`.  
  - Increment `num` by `1`.  
  - Repeat the process while `num * num < 100`.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the output as the program prints a sequence of numbers along with their squared values.  
3. The loop terminates once `num * num` reaches or exceeds `100`.  
4. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Modify the program to print both `num` and its square explicitly.  
- Allow the user to specify a custom limit instead of `100`.
