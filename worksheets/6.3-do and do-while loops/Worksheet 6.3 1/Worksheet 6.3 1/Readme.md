# Worksheet 6.1 - Console Application  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to iterate through a range of numbers and print those that are divisible by `3`.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `num = 3`.  
- Uses a **while loop** to:  
  - Check if `num` is divisible by `3`.  
  - If true, print `num`.  
  - Increment `num` by `2`.  
  - Repeat the process while `num <= 17`.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the numbers that are divisible by `3` within the given range.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to input a custom range of numbers.  
- Modify the loop to handle different divisibility checks.
