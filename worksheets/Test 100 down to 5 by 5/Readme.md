# Test: Counting Down from 100 to 5 by 5  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `while` loop to decrement a number from `100` down to `5` in steps of `5`, printing each value along the way.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes an integer variable `p = 100`.  
- Uses a **while loop** to:  
  - Print the current value of `p`.  
  - Subtract `5` from `p` in each iteration.  
  - Continue looping while `p > 0`.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the countdown from `100` to `5`, decreasing in steps of `5`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to specify custom start, end, and step values.  
- Modify the loop condition to stop exactly at `5` instead of going below `0`.
