# Worksheet 6 - For Loop Counting  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers and print each value.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes two integer variables:  
  - `begin = 1` (starting value).  
  - `end = 5` (ending value).  
- Uses a **for loop** to:  
  - Iterate from `begin` to `end`, inclusive.  
  - Print the current value of `i` at each iteration.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the numbers printed from `1` to `5`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to define custom start and end values.  
- Modify the loop to handle different step values (e.g., counting by 2s).
