# Worksheet 6 - For Loop Countdown  

## Overview  
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a `for` loop to count down from a starting value to an ending value while printing each step.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- **Prints** `"Hello World!"` to indicate the start of the program.  
- Initializes two integer variables:  
  - `begin = 5` (starting value).  
  - `end = 0` (ending value).  
- Uses a **for loop** to:  
  - Start at `begin` and decrement `i` until it reaches `end`.  
  - Print the current value of `i` at each iteration.  
- Prompts the user to press any key to exit.  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the program.  
2. Observe the countdown from `5` to `0`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to define custom start and end values.  
- Modify the loop to include step-size adjustments for different countdown speeds.
