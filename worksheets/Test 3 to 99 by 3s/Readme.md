# Test: Counting from 3 to 99 by 3s  

## Overview  
This C# console application is intended to use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from `3` to `99` in increments of `3`, printing each value. However, the current implementation contains syntax errors that need correction.  

## Functions and Logic  

### `Main(string[] args)`  
- Initializes an integer variable `num = 0`.  
- **Intended** to use a `for` loop to:  
  - Iterate from `3` to `99` in steps of `3`.  
  - Print the current value of `num` at each iteration.  
- **Issues in the code**:  
  - The `for` loop syntax is incorrect: `for (num <= 99);` should be properly structured.  
  - The block of code following the loop is not enclosed correctly.  
  - `num` should be initialized to `3` instead of `0` for correct iteration.  
  - The closing braces `{}` are misplaced, causing a compilation error.  

## Corrected Code (Fixing Errors)  
To achieve the intended functionality, the corrected version should look like this:  
```csharp
using System;

namespace Test_3_to_99_by_3s
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            for (int num = 3; num <= 99; num += 3)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(num);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey(true);
        }
    }
}
```  

## Usage  
1. Compile and run the corrected version of the program.  
2. Observe the output displaying numbers from `3` to `99` in increments of `3`.  
3. Press any key when prompted to exit.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Allow the user to specify custom start, end, and step values.  
- Modify the program to display the numbers in a formatted table.
